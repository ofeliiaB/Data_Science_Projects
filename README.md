### [Project 3: Effect of Number of Children and Gender on Adult Student's Academic Interests and Performance](https://github.com/ofeliiaB/parental_status_vs_college_performance/blob/master/Data_Analytics_Assignment.ipynb)
<br>The project uses survey data on adult students at Robert Kennedy College (Switzerland) to test
<br>whether the number of children and students' gender affect their academic perfomance.
<br>It also tests gender based hypotheses about students' interest on data-related fields.

<br>**Techniques used:**
<br>Data Cleaning, Descriptive Statistics, T-Tests,
<br>Randomization Tests, Chi-Squared Tests,
<br>Comparison of Frequency Distributions, Matplotlib Data Visualization
